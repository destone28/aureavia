Purpose & context
Emilio is developing AureaVia, an NCC (private car service) management system that serves as an intermediary platform between booking platforms like Booking.com and NCC driver networks. The system handles automated booking reception, driver assignment, ride monitoring, and multi-level financial reporting. The project targets two main user types: drivers who monitor and book available rides, and administrators who track rides, manage complaints, and generate reports across multiple partner companies.
As an expert UI/UX developer and MVP specialist for Android/iOS apps, Emilio operates through his company 3DSprinted di Destratis Emilio. The project requires API integration with external booking platforms, comprehensive ride workflow management, and GDPR-compliant data handling. Success involves delivering a functional v1.0 system by March 1, 2026, with scalability planning for future versions.
Current state
Emilio has completed comprehensive project analysis and formal quotation documentation totaling €34,500. The technical foundation includes React + Capacitor for mobile development and Python + FastAPI for backend services. Brand guidelines are established with AureaVia's orange/black color scheme and Open Sans typography. Figma prototypes exist for the driver mobile interface, covering login, dashboard with ride filtering, detailed ride cards, acceptance workflows, and driver profiles.
Current development approach focuses on creating navigable mockups using vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for client demonstrations, prioritizing pixel-perfect matching of Figma designs. The quotation includes milestone-based payment structure and addresses hosting alternatives, with cloud European providers recommended over dedicated servers.
On the horizon
Key upcoming requirements include API access from Booking.com by January 31, 2026, and delivery of v1.0 by March 1, 2026. Version 2.0 planning involves scaling from 30 drivers (v1.0 testing capacity) to 1000 drivers, plus app store publication and production server deployment. Administrative dashboard development awaits additional screenshots and Excel reporting templates.
Future considerations include potential timeline delays if physical server hosting is chosen over cloud hosting, integration of ticketing systems, and expansion to additional booking platform APIs beyond the initial Booking.com integration.
Key learnings & principles
Project timeline distribution follows industry standards: 10-15% analysis/design, 40-50% development, 20-30% testing, and 10-20% implementation/maintenance. For MVP demonstrations, webapp approaches offer zero-friction client access and instant deployment compared to native app distribution challenges.
Cloud hosting provides significant cost advantages (€0 additional vs €10,000 for dedicated servers) while maintaining GDPR compliance requirements. Pixel-perfect mockup delivery using static HTML files eliminates server dependencies and build process complications for client presentations.
Approach & patterns
Development follows iterative refinement with multiple quotation versions incorporating client feedback on costs, timelines, and feature prioritization. Technical analysis includes comprehensive hosting comparisons, security considerations, and scalability planning across system versions.
Documentation approach emphasizes professional PDF quotations with detailed functionality tables, milestone payments, and comprehensive contractual clauses covering exclusivity and account ownership. Mockup development prioritizes exact Figma design matching with interactive behaviors and smooth navigation animations.
Tools & resources
Technology stack centers on React + Capacitor for mobile development, Python + FastAPI for backend services, and Vite + Tailwind CSS for webapp development. Design resources include Figma prototypes, brand guidelines PDF, and AureaVia visual identity specifications.
Development tools include ReportLab for PDF generation, vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for client-ready mockups, and European cloud providers for GDPR-compliant hosting. Integration planning involves Booking.com API documentation and multi-platform booking system architectures.
